> Manage your daily dose of coffee

An App dedicated to manage the coffee you drink in your office. In my coworking, you pay the coffee on the go, a cheap price. Just put 30 cents in the moneybox and you're good to go.

The thing is that you don't have always the correct amount corresponding to your wallet !

This app is here to help if you can drink coffee based on the money you give or if you have to refund the coffee bank !
